"Which of the following techniques can be used for keyword normalization in 
NLP, the process of converting a keyword into its base form? 
a. Lemmatization 
b. Soundex 
c. Cosine Similarity 
d. N-grams","a) Lemmatization helps to get to the base form of a word, e.g. are playing -> play, ea ting 
-> eat, etc.Other options are meant for different purposes."
"Which of the following techniques can be used to compute the distance 
between two word vectors in NLP? 
a. Lemmatization 
b. Euclidean distance 
c. Cosine Similarity 
d. N-grams","b) and c) 
Distance between two word vectors can be computed using Cosine similarity and Euclidean 
Distance.  Cosine Similarity establishes a cosine angle between the vector of two words . A cosi ne 
angle close to each other between two word vectors indicates the words are simil ar and vice a 
versa. 
E.g. cosine angle between two words “Football” and “Cricket” will be closer to 1 as co mpared to 
angle between the words “Football” and “New Delhi”"

Q15 TF-IDF helps you to establish? 
a. most frequently occurring word in the document 
b. most important word in the document 
 
Answer : b) TF-IDF helps to establish how important a particular word is in the contex t of the 
document corpus. TF-IDF takes into account the number of times the word appears in the 
document and offset by the number of documents that appear in the corpus. 
● TF is the frequency of term divided by a total number of terms in the docu ment. 
● IDF is obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documen ts 
containing the term and then taking the logarithm of that quotient. 
Steve Nouri                          https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/  ● Tf.idf is then the multiplication of two values TF and IDF.

"There have some various common elements of natural language processing. 
Those elements are very important for understanding NLP properly, can you please 
explain the same in details with an example?","There have a lot of components normally using by natural language processing (NLP). Some  of 
the major components are explained below: 
● Extraction of Entity: It actually identifying and extracting some critical data from the 
available information which help to segmentation of provided sentence on identifying ea ch 
entity. It can help in identifying one human that it’s fictional or real, same kind of real ity 
identification for any organization, events or any geographic location etc. 
● The analysis in a syntactic way: it mainly helps for maintaining ordering properly of the  
available words. 
Q64 In the case of processing natural language, we normally mentioned one 
common terminology NLP and binding every language with the same terminology 
properly. Please explain in details about this NLP terminology with an example? 
Answer: 
This is the basic NLP Interview Questions asked in an interview. There have some several factors 
available in case of explaining natural language processing. Some of the key factors are given  
below: 
● Vectors and Weights: Google Word vectors, length of TF-IDF, varieties documents, w ord 
vectors, TF-IDF. 
● Structure of Text: Named Entities, tagging of part of speech, identifying the head of the 
sentence. 
● Analysis of sentiment: Know about the features of sentiment, entities available for the 
sentiment, sentiment common dictionary. 
● Classification of Text: Learning supervising, set off a train, set of validation  in Dev, Set of 
define test, a feature of the individual text, LDA. 
● Reading of Machine Language: Extraction of the possible entity, linking with an individual 
entity, DBpedia, some libraries like Pikes or FRED. 
 
Q65 Explain briefly about word2vec 
Word2Vec  embeds words in a lower-dimensional vector space using a shallow neural networ k. 
The result is a set of word-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar 
meanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have differing mea nings. For 
example, apple and orange would be close together and apple and gravity would be relative ly far. 
Steve Nouri                          https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/  There are two versions of this model based on skip-grams (SG) and continuous- bag-of-words 
(CBOW). 
 
Q66 What are the metrics used to test an NLP model? 
Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1. Accuracy is the usual ratio of the prediction t o the desired 
output. But going just be accuracy is naive considering the complexities involved.  
 
Q67 What are some ways we can preprocess text input? 
Here are several preprocessing steps that are commonly used for NLP tasks: 
● case normalization: we can convert all input to the same case (lowercase or uppercase) 
as a way of reducing our text to a more canonical form 
● punctuation/stop word/white space/special characters removal: if we don’t think these 
words or characters are relevant, we can remove them to reduce the feature space 
● lemmatizing/stemming: we can also reduce words to their inflecti onal forms (i.e. walks → 
walk) to further trim our vocabulary 
● generalizing irrelevant information: we can replace all numbers with a <NUMBER > token 
or all names with a <NAME> token 
 
 
Q68 How does the encoder-decoder structure work for language modelling? 
The encoder-decoder structure is a deep learning model architecture responsible for several s tate 
of the art solutions, including Machine Translation. 
The input sequence is passed to the encoder where it is transformed to a fixed -dimensional vector 
representation using a neural network. The transformed input is then decoded using anothe r 
neural network. Then, these outputs undergo another transformation and a softmax l ayer. The 
final output is a vector of probabilities over the vocabularies. Meaningful informatio n is extracted 
based on these probabilities. 
 
Q69 What are attention mechanisms and why do we use them? 
This was a followup to the encoder-decoder question. Only the output from  the last time step is 
passed to the decoder, resulting in a loss of information learned at previou s time steps. This 
information loss is compounded for longer text sequences with more time steps. 
Attention mechanisms are a function of the hidden weights at each time  step. When we use 
attention in encoder-decoder networks, the fixed-dimensional vector passed to t he decoder 
becomes a function of all vectors outputted in the intermediary steps. 
Two commonly used attention mechanisms are additive attention and multiplicative attention. A s 
the names suggest, additive attention is a weighted sum while multiplicative attention i s a 
weighted multiplier of the hidden weights. During the training process, the m odel also learns 
weights for the attention mechanisms to recognize the relative importance of each time step. 
 
Q70 How would you implement an NLP system as a service, and what are some 
pitfalls you might face in production? 
This is less of a NLP question than a question for productionizing machine learning models. There 
are however certain intricacies to NLP models. 
Steve Nouri                          https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/  Without diving too much into the productionization aspect, an ideal Machine Learning service wi ll 
have: 
● endpoint(s) that other business systems can use to make inference 
● a feedback mechanism for validating model predictions 
● a database to store predictions and ground truths from the feedback 
● a workflow orchestrator which will (upon some signal) re-train and load the ne w model for 
serving based on the records from the database + any prior training data 
● some form of model version control to facilitate rollbacks in case of bad deployments 
● post- production accuracy and error monitoring 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q71 How can we handle misspellings for text input? 
By using word embeddings trained over a large corpus (for instance, an extensive web scrape of 
billions of words), the model vocabulary would include common misspellings by design. The 
model can then learn the relationship between misspelled and correctly spelled words to 
recognize their semantic similarity. 
We can also preprocess the input to prevent misspellings. Terms not found in the m odel 
vocabulary can be mapped to the “closest” vocabulary term using:  
● edit distance between strings 
● phonetic distance between word pronunciations 
● keyword distance to catch common typos 
 
Q72 Which of the following models can perform tweet classification with regards 
to context mentioned above? 
A) Naive Bayes 
B) SVM 
C) None of the above 
Solution: (C) 
Since, you are given only the data of tweets and no other information, whi ch means there is no 
target variable present. One cannot train a supervised learning model, both svm and naive bayes 
are supervised learning techniques. 
 
Q73 You have created a document term matrix of the data, treating every tweet as 
one document. Which of the following is correct, in regards to document term 
matrix? 
1. Removal of stopwords from the data will affect the dimensionality of data 
2. Normalization of words in the data will reduce the dimensionality of data 
Steve Nouri                          https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/  3. Converting all the words in lowercase will not affect the dimensionality of the  data 
A) Only 1 
B) Only 2 
C) Only 3 
D) 1 and 2 
E) 2 and 3 
F) 1, 2 and 3 
Solution: (D) 
Choices A and B are correct because stopword removal will decrease the number of feature s in 
the matrix, normalization of words will also reduce redundant features, and, convert ing all words 
to lowercase will also decrease the dimensionality. 
  
 
 
 
 
Q74 Which of the following features can be used for accuracy improvement of a 
classification model? 
A) Frequency count of terms 
B) Vector Notation of sentence 
C) Part of Speech Tag 
D) Dependency Grammar 
E) All of these 
Solution: (E) 
All of the techniques can be used for the purpose of engineering features in a model. 
  
Q75 What percentage of the total statements are correct with regards to Topic 
Modeling? 
1. It is a supervised learning technique 
2. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) can be used to perform topic modeling 
3. Selection of number of topics in a model does not depend on the size of data 
4. Number of topic terms are directly proportional to size of the data 
A) 0 
B) 25 
C) 50 
D) 75 
E) 100 
Solution: (A) 
LDA is unsupervised learning model, LDA is latent Dirichlet allocation, not Linear discriminant 
analysis. Selection of the number of topics is directly proportional to the size of the dat a, while 
number of topic terms is not directly proportional to the size of the data. Hence no ne of the 
statements are correct. 
  
Steve Nouri                          https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/  Q76 In Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for text classification purposes, what does 
alpha and beta hyperparameter represent- 
A) Alpha: number of topics within documents, beta: number of terms within topi cs False 
B) Alpha: density of terms generated within topics, beta: density of top ics generated within terms 
False 
C) Alpha: number of topics within documents, beta: number of terms within topi cs False 
D) Alpha: density of topics generated within documents, beta: density of term s generated within 
topics True 
Solution: (D) 
Option D is correct 
 
 
 
 
 
Q77 What is the problem with ReLu? 
● Exploding gradient(Solved by gradient clipping) 
● Dying ReLu — No learning if the activation is 0 (Solved by parametric rel u) 
● Mean and variance of activations is not 0 and 1.(Partially solved by subtracting around 0.5 
from activation. Better explained in fastai videos) 
 
Q78 What is the difference between learning latent features using SVD and getting 
embedding vectors using deep network? 
SVD uses linear combination of inputs while a neural network uses nonlinear combination . 
 
Q79 What is the information in the hidden and cell state of LSTM? 
Hidden stores all the information till that time step and cell state stores  particular information that 
might be needed in the future time step. 
Number of parameters in an LSTM model with bias 
4(𝑚h+h²+h) where 𝑚 is input vectors size and h is output vectors size a.k.a. hidden 
The point to see here is that mh dictates the model size as m>>h. Hence  it's important to have a 
small vocab. 
Time complexity of LSTM 
seq_length*hidden² 
Time complexity of transfomer 
seq_length²*hidden 
When hidden size is more than the seq_length(which is normally the case), transfomer is faster 
than LSTM. 
 
Q80 When is self-attention not faster than recurrent layers? 
When the sequence length is greater than the representation dimensions. This is rare.  
 
Q81 What is the benefit of learning rate warm- up? 
Steve Nouri                          https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/  Learning rate warm-up is a learning rate schedule where you have low (or lower) learning rate at 
the beginning of training to avoid divergence due to unreliable gradients at the beginning. As t he 
model becomes more stable, the learning rate would increase to speed up convergence. 
 
Q82 What’s the difference between hard and soft parameter sharing in multi -task 
learning? 
Hard sharing is where we train for all the task at the same time and update our weights using all 
the losses whereas soft sharing is where we train for one task at a time. 
 
Q83 What’s the difference between BatchNorm and LayerNorm?  
BatchNorm computes the mean and variance at each layer for every minibatch whereas 
LayerNorm computes the mean and variance for every sample for each layer independently.  
Batch normalisation allows you to set higher learning rates, increasing speed of  training as it 
reduces the unstability of initial starting weights. 
Q84 Difference between BatchNorm and LayerNorm? 
BatchNorm — Compute the mean and var at each layer for every minibatch 
LayerNorm — Compute the mean and var for every single sample for each layer independently 
 
Q85 Why does the transformer block have LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm? 
Looking at the advantages of LayerNorm, it is robust to batch size and works better as i t works at 
the sample level and not batch level. 
 
Q86 What changes would you make to your deep learning code if you knew there  
are errors in your training data? 
We can do label smoothening where the smoothening value is based on % error. If any particular 
class has known error, we can also use class weights to modify the loss. 
 
Q87 What are the tricks used in ULMFiT? (Not a great questions but checks the 
awareness) 
● LM tuning with task text 
● Weight dropout 
● Discriminative learning rates for layers 
● Gradual unfreezing of layers 
● Slanted triangular learning rate schedule 
This can be followed up with a question on explaining how they help. 
 
Q88 Tell me a language model whi ch doesn’t use dropout  
ALBERT v2 — This throws a light on the fact that a lot of assumptions we take for granted are  
not necessarily true. The regularisation effect of parameter sharing in ALBERT is so strong that 
dropouts are not needed. (ALBERT v1 had dropouts.) 
 
Q89 What are the differences between GPT and GPT-2? (From Lilian Weng) 
Steve Nouri                          https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/  ● Layer normalization  was moved to the input of each sub-block, similar to a residual unit of 
type “building block”  (differently from the original type  “bottleneck” , it has batch 
normalization applied before weight layers). 
● An additional layer normalization was added after the final self-attention block. 
● A modified initialization was constructed as a function of the model depth. 
● The weights of residual layers were initially sca led by a factor of 1/√n where n is the 
number of residual layers. 
● Use larger vocabulary size and context size. 
 
Q90 What are the differences between GPT and BERT? 
 
● GPT is not bidirectional and has no concept of masking 
● BERT adds next sentence prediction task in training and so it also has a seg ment 
embedding 
Q91 What are the differences between BERT and ALBERT v2? 
● Embedding matrix factorisation(helps in reducing no. of parameters) 
● No dropout 
● Parameter sharing(helps in reducing no. of parameters and regularisation) 
Q92 How does parameter sharing in ALBERT affect the training and inference time? 
No effect. Parameter sharing just decreases the number of parameters. 
Q93 How would you reduce the inference time of a trained NN model? 
● Serve on GPU/TPU/FPGA 
● 16 bit quantisation and served on GPU with fp16 support 
● Pruning to reduce parameters 
● Knowledge distillation (To a smaller transformer model or simple neural network) 
● Hierarchical softmax/Adaptive softmax 
● You can also cache results as explained here. 
Q94 Would you use BPE with classical models? 
Of course! BPE is a smart tokeniser and it can help us get a smaller vocabu lary which can help 
us find a model with less parameters. 
Q95 How would you make an arxiv papers search engine? (I was asked — How 
would you make a plagiarism detector?) 
 
Get top k results with TF-IDF similarity and then rank results with

Q97 How would you make a sentiment classifier? 
This is a trick question. The interviewee can say all things such as using transfer l earning and 
latest models but they need to talk about having a neutral class too otherwise you can have really 
good accuracy/f1 and still, the model will classify everything into positive or nega tive. 
The truth is that a lot of news is neutral and so the training need s to have this class. The 
interviewee should also talk about how he will create a dataset and his training st rategies like the 
selection of language model, language model fine-tuning and using various datasets for multi-
task learning. 
Q98 What is the difference between regular expression and regular grammar? 
A regular expression is the representation of natural language in the form of mathe matical 
expressions containing a character sequence. On the other hand, regular grammar is th e 
generator of natural language, defining a set of defined rules and syntax which the strings in the 
natural l anguage must follow.  
 
Q99 Why should we use Batch Normalization? 
Once the interviewer has asked you about the fundamentals of deep learning architect ures, they 
would move on to the key topic of improving your deep learning model’s perform ance.  
Batch Normalization is one of the techniques used for reducing the training time of our deep 
learning algorithm. Just like normalizing our input helps improve our logist ic regression model, we 
can normalize the activations of the hidden layers in our deep learning model as well: 
 
Q100 How is backpropagation different in RNN compared to ANN? 
In Recurrent Neural Networks, we have an additional loop at each node: 
This loop essentially includes a time component into the network as well. This helps in capturing 
sequential information from the data, which could not be possible in a generic art ificial neural 
network. 
This is why the backpropagation in RNN is called Backpropagation through Time, as in  
backpropagation at each time step."

Key points a candidate might mention: Look for candidates who can explain how attention addresses the limitations of fixed-length context vectors in sequence-to-sequence models. They should also be able to discuss different types of attention (e.g., soft vs. hard attention) and mention real-world applications where attention has made a significant impact, such as in machine translation ortext summarization."
How would you approach the task of named entity recognition (NER) using machine learning?,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of identifying and classifying named entities (like persons, organizations, locations) in text. A strong candidate should outline a machine learning approach to NER: Look for candidates who understand the sequence labeling nature of NER and can discuss the challenges, such as handling ambiguous entities or dealing with domain-specific named entities. They should also be aware of recent advancements, like the use of pre-trained language models for NER tasks."
Explain the concept of transfer learning in NLP and give an example of its application.,"Transfer learning in NLP involves using knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on a different, but related, task. This approach is particularly powerful when dealing with limited labeled data for the target task. A common example is using pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT. These models are trained on large amounts of general text data and can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, or text classification with relatively small amounts of task-specific data. Look for candidates who can explain the benefits of transfer learning, such as reduced training time and improved performance on tasks with limited data. They should also be aware of potential challenges, like catastrophic forgetting or domain mismatch between the source and target tasks. Candidates might also discuss more advanced concepts like few-shot or zero-shot learning in the context of transfer learning."
How would you handle multilingual text processing in an NLP project?,"Handling multilingual text processing requires careful consideration of various factors. A strong candidate should discuss several approaches: Look for candidates who understand the challenges of multilingual processing, such as handling languages with different scripts, word order, or grammatical structures. They should also be aware of recent advancements in multilingual models like mBERT or XLM-R, which can process multiple languages without explicit translation."
Describe the process of building a simple chatbot using NLP techniques.,"Building a simple chatbot using NLP techniques typically involves the following steps: Look for candidates who can explain different approaches to each step, such as rule-based vs. machine learning-based intent recognition, or template-based vs. generative response generation. They should also discuss considerations like handling context, managing conversation state, and dealing with ambiguity or errors in user input. Bonus points if they mention techniques for improving the chatbot over time, such as incorporating user feedback or using reinforcement learning."
How would you approach the problem of sentiment analysis for social media posts?,"Approaching sentiment analysis for social media posts requires considering several unique challenges. A strong candidate might outline the following approach: Look for candidates who understand the nuances of social media text, such as informal language, abbreviations, and the use of emojis to convey sentiment. They should also discuss strategies for dealing with imbalanced datasets (as positive and negative sentiments might not be equally represented) and methods for handling multi-class sentiment analysis (e.g., very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive). Assessing a candidate's full range of skills and capabilities in a single interview is challenging. However, focusing on certain key skills during the interview phase is important for gauging their potential in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here are the core skills to evaluate to ensure you find the right fit for your team."
Text Preprocessing,"You can use an assessment test that asks relevantMCQsto filter out this skill. Consider using ourNatural Language Processing Testfor this purpose. During the interview, you can ask targeted questions to assess the candidate's understanding and experience with text preprocessing techniques. Can you explain the process you would use to clean and preprocess a large corpus of text data? Look for candidates who mention steps like tokenization, removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and handling different types of noise in the data. Their ability to detail these steps demonstrates their understanding of text preprocessing."
Feature Engineering,"You can filter candidates' skills in feature engineering by using ourMachine Learning Testto assess their knowledge in this area indirectly. Asking targeted questions about feature engineering can help you understand a candidate's creativity and problem-solving skills in complex NLP tasks. How would you create features for a sentiment analysis model from a set of product reviews? Candidates should mention techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, n-grams, and possibly domain-specific features. Their ability to explain why and how they would use these features is key."
Model Evaluation,"Use ourMachine Learning Testwhich includes questions on model evaluation techniques to gauge this skill. In the interview, you can ask questions focused on evaluating NLP models to see if the candidate understands different metrics and validation techniques. What metrics would you use to evaluate a named entity recognition model, and why? Look for answers mentioning precision, recall, F1-score, and the importance of a balanced dataset for validation. Candidates should also discuss the trade-offs between these metrics. Before you start putting what you've learned into practice, here are our tips for using NLP interview questions effectively."
Leverage Skill Tests Before Interviews,"Using skill tests before interviews can help you filter out unsuitable candidates early, saving time and resources. Consider using specialized tests such as theAdaface NLP Online Testor theMachine Learning Online Test. The benefits of this approach include a more focused interview process, as you'll be speaking only to those who have demonstrated the required skills. This ensures your interviews are both efficient and effective."
Compile and Outline Your Interview Questions,"Time during an interview is limited, so it's important to carefully select the most relevant questions to assess the candidate’s abilities. Include questions that cover a range of skills and topics. For instance, you could incorporate questions related to both technical definitions and machine learning techniques. Additionally, consider including somesoft skills interview questionsto ensure a holistic evaluation of the candidate."
Ask Follow-Up Questions,"Simply asking the prepared questions may not be enough. Follow-up questions can help you gauge the depth of a candidate's knowledge and their problem-solving capabilities. For example, if you ask a candidate to explain the concept of word embeddings, a good follow-up question could be, 'Can you describe a scenario where using word embeddings would be advantageous?' This helps you assess not just their theoretical knowledge but also their practical understanding. If you are looking to hire someone with NLP skills, you need to ensure they have those skills accurately. The best way to do this is by using skill tests such as ourNLP online test.
